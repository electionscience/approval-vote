  produce a lot of data about voter preferences. Typically, this information is
  made available by election boards in specialized file formats and requires
  processing to interpret. The purpose of approval.vote is to increase transparency into these
  elections by creating detailed and intuitive reports about them.</p> <p>Approval voting is a voting system that allows voters to vote for as many
  candidates as they like. It is a simple and intuitive system that
  produces results that are easy to understand and verify.</p> <p>All reports are generated from the raw ballot data, rather than using the
  official tabulation. As a result, the reports also serve as an independent
  tabulation of the results that can be reproduced using published source code.</p> <p>approval.vote is maintained by
